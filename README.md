## Description
This README Generator is a command-line application that automates the process of creating a README file for your projects. It uses the Inquirer.js library to prompt users with a series of questions to help them include essential aspects such of their project.


## Usage
Access your terminal and type "node index.js" to begin using the application. Once started, you will be asked a series of questions to build out your README file.

Once the you provide your answers, the application generates a README file in markdown format. The generated README file incorporates your responses, creating a well-structured and professional document. This tool streamlines the often repetitive and time-consuming task of creating a README, ensuring that developers can quickly and consistently document their projects.

### Important!

Make sure node.js is installed and run "npm i" to install all dependencies. You will see a package.json file and package-lock.json file if installed correctly.
